# UploadToVimeo

In this app I try to use Polymer to upload video to a Vimeo.com account with only a accessToken.

There are some problems that needs to be dealt with.

Console log shows: 

[vimeo-upload::_createEventHandler]: listener method `{{handleFileChanged}}` not defined

[vimeo-upload::_createEventHandler]: listener method `{{handleUploadClicked}}` not defined


although the script with handleFileChanged and handleUploadClicked is in the same vimeo-upload.html
